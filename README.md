# Work Harder

This project came along from a necessity of my own, Irio Musskopf. Running a crowdfunding campaign on [Catarse](https://www.catarse.me/), called "[Serenata de Amor Operation](https://www.catarse.me/serenata)", I asked myself a question after a couple weeks past the publication of the draft: **should we work harder, or much harder** to be successful and raise the money we wanted?

Here are the results of my research, trying to predict the successability of a crowdfunding campaign on Catarse using Machine Learning.
