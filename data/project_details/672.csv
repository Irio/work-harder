672,672,51385,"Veil of Truth - Human Nature","Humanity has reached the stars, but nothing was as we expected. Veil of Truth: Human Nature tells the tale of Humanity after Revelation Day.","O orçamento para projetos anteriores a 24/02/2015 normalmente pode ser encontrado na descrição acima.",3000.0,"<p>It was in the late years of the 21st Century, while Humanity was immersed in a new Cold War, that we stumbled upon them. We were not alone. Worse: we had been under supervision by aliens for centuries, considered too primitive to handle the truth.</p>

<p>And we soon proved them right.</p>

<p>Earth plunged into chaos. Nations shattered, religions split, revolts consumed the world. Thousands died and the face of the planet changed.</p>

<p>But humans are adaptable. We survived and we forced ourselves into Galactic Society. We were the Galaxy’s underdeveloped species, the inferior race, the second-rate citizen.</p>

<p>Veil of Truth - Human Nature is a 64-pages campaign book that brings you:
 * A gazetteer about each of the planets under Human control, both in and out of the Solar system;
 * An update on every one of the major human governments in the 22nd century;
 * Entries on each of the corporations powerful enough to obtain sovereignty by the UN;
 * Extrasolar colonies and organizations that dared leave the Free March and enter the unknown;
 * Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules for human character, high tech equipment and more.</p>

<p>Fly into the Saturn warzone, visit the dangerous streets of Mars, operate one of Lester-Campbell’s power suits and fight the corporate wars on the streets. Go further away to the ocean-world of Toliman, where the European Union, the United States of North America and the League of Worlds fight for control.</p>

<p>While aimed at the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, this is a rules-lite lore book, so that it’s not only easily adaptable to any game system, but also a great read for science fiction fans!</p>

<p>Will you help Humanity reach the stars?</p>

<p>Funding:
This crowdfunding campaign is aimed gathering R$ 3.000 (approximately $ 1.560 dollars) at paying for the book’s illustrations as well as a small print run and revision work. It is also a first step into producing a larger number of professional quality products, as this is mostly a one-man army project. And, most of all, help me convince my wife this kind of product sells!</p>

<p>Dates:
We expect to have the e-book done by early July (possibly earlier) and the printed version ready for shipping a month afterwards. Rewards that include the miniatures shouldn’t take any longer than that.</p>

<p>Stretch Goals:
What if we get more than our goal? More means more, of course!</p>

<p>If we reach R$4.000 reais ($2083 which, by the way, is the year of first contact!) I will write an exclusive novella that will be shared as a PDF with all backers. The theme of the novella will be voted by backers out of a list of possibilities after the end of the campaign.</p>

<p>If we get to R$6.000 reais ($3125), I will create an exclusive introductory adventure available only for backers. The adventure will be available as PDF for all backers and also in print for anyone pledging R$35 or more.</p>

<p>What if we get more? Well, who knows? Let’s find out!</p>
