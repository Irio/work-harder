Feel free to give whatever God puts in your heart!</p><p>All the money we earn will be used for this purpose only.</p>",2000.0,"<p>Our Church is planning to buy a building in a very poor neighbourhood. God's given us this purpose: to bless the people of this community with the Gospel of Jesus Christ!<br></p><p>There are many people in there, especially children, who are getting lost in drugs, addictions, prostitution, crimes etc.; we want to be and make the difference in their lives! We want to show them that only Jesus can set one free, and He is the only one who gives us a purpose in this life! Now we have the opportunity to be among these people, and you can also be a part of this mission!</p><p>Please, consider joining us in this project, by giving one offering of any value, and praying for us. Remember: Missions are done by the knees of those who pray, the feet of those who go and the hands of those who give.</p><p><br></p><p>May God bless your life!</p>",a_building_for_my_church_780a,,,Educação,31,https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.br.catarse/uploads/project/uploaded_image/37431/templo.JPG,https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.br.catarse/uploads/project/uploaded_image/37431/project_thumb_thumb_templo.JPG,https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.br.catarse/uploads/project/uploaded_image/37431/project_thumb_small_templo.JPG,https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.br.catarse/uploads/project/uploaded_image/37431/project_thumb_large_templo.JPG,https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.br.catarse/uploads/project/uploaded_image/37431/project_thumb_video_cover_templo.JPG,0,0,0,0,failed,flex,finished,"2016-08-05 02:59:59.999999","2016-08-04 23:59:59.999999","2016-07-15 12:54:59.039103","2016-07-15 09:54:59.039103",,t,t,f,20,"{""total"" : 0, ""unit"" : ""seconds""}","{""total"" : 20, ""unit"" : ""days""}",0,"{""city"" : ""Santo André"", ""state_acronym"" : ""SP"", ""state"" : ""São Paulo""}","{""id"" : 606155, ""name"" : ""Maurivam Junior""}",0,,f,f,0,f,f,f
